### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

My work and research live at the intersection of technology and trading. I am currently focused on:

* **📈 Machine/Deep Learning in Finance:** Applying Deep Learning models (TensorFlow/PyTorch) and time-series analysis to forecast market movements and model risk.
* **🤖 AI Agentic Workflows:** Building autonomous agents with LangChain and LangGraph to perform complex financial research and data analysis (like the text-to-SQL framework I built professionally).
* **📊 Trading Strategy Backtesting:** Developing and vector-testing event-driven trading strategies in Python and C++ to identify alpha.
